1) try again with reference electrode

2) CSP (lab 5 of BCI) there is an extention for multiple classes, but the easiest way is a dicotomical comparison

3) NeuralNetwork I'll run some tests to see how long it takes to train

4) maybe some patterns should be discarded (eg early samples of each event)



Mannes
1) use switch instead of baseline (real or SSVEP)
2) reduce number of classes
